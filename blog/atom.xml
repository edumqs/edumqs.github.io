        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone!</p><p>I have one more great update for you!</p><p>The past few weeks were spent on adding support for file uploads! That's right! Now, with RESTED_DEV you can also uploads files used in your application. How cool is that? As you can see I'm pretty excited about this!</p><p>Let me give you a quick introduction to this feature.</p><p>To upload files you don't need any special endpoint, you can create endpoint to upload file in the same way you did for data. The main difference, besides the files, is the <em>Content-Type</em> of the request, it must be <strong>multipart/form-data</strong>, and the files must be sent using the fieldname <strong>file</strong> and using <b><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FormData</a></b> when uploading from the web.</p><p>And that's it, you can now upload files! Have a look at this <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/testing-file-upload-tg0xh?file=/src/App.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a> to see file uploads in action.</p><p>There are a few more things to consider:</p><ul><li>You can upload up to 10 files in one request.</li><li>Each file can be up to 100MB.</li></ul><p>The size occupied by the files in your endpoint will be shown on the Dashboard.</p><p>To find out more about this new update please check the docs for <a href="/docs/file-uploads/file-uploads">File Uploads</a>.</p><p>I hope you find this update useful! In case of any questions, you can contact me directly or use our discord channel!</p><p>Take care!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi all!</p><p>For any REST API, operations like querying, sorting, filtering are a must have. In the beginning I assumed that it was good enough for the client to fetch all the data, and perform these operations on their side. This was good enough for a PoC or a PET project, but far from ideal for a production application, not only because of the size of the data transferred, but also had security implications, as some sensitive data could be exposed.</p><p>I wondered for a while what would be the best and quickest solution for this. Implementing all of this came through my head, but then I thought, this is a common problem and I'm sure there are existing solutions for this.</p><p>I was right! I came across <strong>JSONata</strong>, a really powerful library that did everything what I was looking for and more!</p><p>All I had to do was add support for JSONata expressions for GET requests and it worked perfectly.</p><p><strong>How does it work?</strong>
GET requests accept a new parameter called <strong>jsonata</strong> that accepts encoded JSONata expressions.</p><p>If you want to take full advantage of this library check out the official documentation on their <a href="https://docs.jsonata.org/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page</a>, or, to get started quickly, check the <a href="/docs/crud/crud-read">READ (GET) documentation</a> and the <a href="/docs/jsonata">JSONata documentation</a>.</p><p>I hope you find these expressions useful. If you have any questions don't hesitate to reach out, after all, feedback is what makes any product great!</p><p>Take care and until the next one!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone!</p><p>Wanted to give you a quick update and share with you my experience from this weekend, since it was craaazyy!!</p><p>I decided that it was good idea to start talking about RESTED_DEV in some platforms for developers, and since I'm a Reddit user I shared the service in the Javascript subreddit. And wow, I had an explosion of requests!</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Service usage" src="/assets/images/Stats_20210131-170326-884e2dee4043c5c43c72d9078bbacc34.jpg" width="1080" height="1349" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This shows how important these communities are. After all, one of the hardest parts of building something it to get users in the beginning, so these platforms for sure help. I also enjoy <a href="https://dev.to" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev.to</a> and soon will start posting some articles there, so make sure you check it out.</p><p>And ah, remember to give something back, in my case I intend to share some of the things I'm learning during this project.</p><p>If you are interested in the post on Reddit, here you go: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/l8omne/yawe_create_crud_endpoints_connected_to_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/l8omne/yawe_create_crud_endpoints_connected_to_a/</a>.</p><p>Take care guys!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi all!</p><p>There’s a new feature available: <strong>Master Keys!!</strong></p><p>Now, let me give you a bit of background why these keys are important.</p><p>I also use RESTED_DEV for other projects as it is a good way to test the service and see what’s missing. During one of those projects I realized that there was no way to access the data stored in secure endpoints, and the same for Authentication endpoints. Secure endpoints require you to be logged in, and Authentication endpoints data is only accessible to its creator.</p><p>This was problematic because, as a developer I might need to check the data stored, or modify it in case of problems.</p><p><em>TLDR:</em> Master Keys allow you to access the data in all your endpoints, it removes the need for Access tokens or restrictions applied to Authentication endpoints.</p><p>And ah, one tip, don’t use Master keys directly in your application, it leaves the endpoint unprotected.</p><p>You can find more details in the <a href="/docs/getting-started/projects#master-key">Project documentation</a>.</p><p>I hope you guys find this feature useful. If you have any questions don’t hesitate to contact us!</p><p>Stay safe!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi and welcome to RESTED_DEV!</p><p>I'm super excited to share RESTED_DEV with the world and I really hope it will help lots of people!</p><p><strong>So, what is this service?</strong></p><p>As many other developers I love to put my ideas into practice or simply explore the new tech that is out there, especially in the front-end world. But I always faced the same problem. To start a new project that required storing data I have to write a new back-end (or copy), and most of times it's either for authentication or to have CRUD endpoints.</p><p>So I decided to write a generic back-end that I could reuse for these projects. And yes, I'm sure you are thinking it, during development I actually realized that this could be helpful for other developers as well, and that's how RESTED_DEV was born, YOUR API WITH EASE!</p><p>Now, I do acknowledge that there are other solutions out there and more powerful than RESTED_DEV. For example Firebase. The difference is, with RESTED_DEV you use plain old HTTP requests, which I'm sure all of you are familiar with, and you are not required to learn a new library.</p><p><strong>Who is this for?</strong></p><p>For all developers who need a place to store data, without having to create a back-end service or manage a database. RESTED_DEV does it for you!</p><hr><p>Do you have any questions?

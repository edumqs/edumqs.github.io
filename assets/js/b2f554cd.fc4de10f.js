That\'s right! Now, with RESTED_DEV you can also uploads files used in your application. How cool is that? As you can see I\'m pretty excited about this!\\n\\nLet me give you a quick introduction to this feature.\\n\\nTo upload files you don\'t need any special endpoint, you can create endpoint to upload file in the same way you did for data. The main difference, besides the files, is the _Content-Type_ of the request, it must be **multipart/form-data**, and the files must be sent using the fieldname **file** and using <b>[FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData)</b> when uploading from the web.\\n\\nAnd that\'s it, you can now upload files! Have a look at this [example](https://codesandbox.io/s/testing-file-upload-tg0xh?file=/src/App.js) to see file uploads in action.\\n\\nThere are a few more things to consider:\\n* You can upload up to 10 files in one request.\\n* Each file can be up to 100MB.\\n\\nThe size occupied by the files in your endpoint will be shown on the Dashboard.\\n\\nTo find out more about this new update please check the docs for [File Uploads](/docs/file-uploads/file-uploads).\\n\\nI hope you find this update useful! In case of any questions, you can contact me directly or use our discord channel!\\n\\nTake care!"},{"id":"jsonata","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/jsonata","source":"@site/blog/2021-02-09-jsonata.md","title":"JSONata","description":"Hi all!","date":"2021-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 9, 2021","tags":[{"label":"rested","permalink":"/blog/tags/rested"},{"label":"jsonata","permalink":"/blog/tags/jsonata"},{"label":"filter","permalink":"/blog/tags/filter"},{"label":"sort","permalink":"/blog/tags/sort"},{"label":"pagination","permalink":"/blog/tags/pagination"}],"readingTime":1.215,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Marques","title":"Software Engineer @ RESTED_DEV","imageURL":"/img/edu.png"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"jsonata","title":"JSONata","author":"Eduardo Marques","author_title":"Software Engineer @ RESTED_DEV","author_image_url":"/img/edu.png","tags":["rested","jsonata","filter","sort","pagination"]},"prevItem":{"title":"File uploads","permalink":"/blog/file-uploads"},"nextItem":{"title":"Importance of platforms like Reddit","permalink":"/blog/redditimportance"}},"content":"Hi all!\\n\\nFor any REST API, operations like querying, sorting, filtering are a must have. In the beginning I assumed that it was good enough for the client to fetch all the data, and perform these operations on their side. This was good enough for a PoC or a PET project, but far from ideal for a production application, not only because of the size of the data transferred, but also had security implications, as some sensitive data could be exposed.\\n\\nI wondered for a while what would be the best and quickest solution for this. Implementing all of this came through my head, but then I thought, this is a common problem and I\'m sure there are existing solutions for this.\\n\\nI was right! I came across **JSONata**, a really powerful library that did everything what I was looking for and more!\\n\\nAll I had to do was add support for JSONata expressions for GET requests and it worked perfectly.\\n\\n**How does it work?**\\nGET requests accept a new parameter called **jsonata** that accepts encoded JSONata expressions.\\n\\nIf you want to take full advantage of this library check out the official documentation on their [page](https://docs.jsonata.org/overview.html), or, to get started quickly, check the [READ (GET) documentation](/docs/crud/crud-read) and the [JSONata documentation](/docs/jsonata).\\n\\nI hope you find these expressions useful.

And wow, I had an explosion of requests!\\n\\n![Service usage](/img/Stats_20210131-170326.jpg)\\n\\nThis shows how important these communities are.

During one of those projects I realized that there was no way to access the data stored in secure endpoints, and the same for Authentication endpoints. Secure endpoints require you to be logged in, and Authentication endpoints data is only accessible to its creator.\\n\\nThis was problematic because, as a developer I might need to check the data stored, or modify it in case of problems.\\n\\n_TLDR:_ Master Keys allow you to access the data in all your endpoints, it removes the need for Access tokens or restrictions applied to Authentication endpoints.\\n\\nAnd ah, one tip, don\u2019t use Master keys directly in your application, it leaves the endpoint unprotected.\\n\\nYou can find more details in the [Project documentation](/docs/getting-started/projects#master-key).\\n\\nI hope you guys find this feature useful.

But I always faced the same problem. To start a new project that required storing data I have to write a new back-end (or copy), and most of times it\'s either for authentication or to have CRUD endpoints.\\n\\nSo I decided to write a generic back-end that I could reuse for these projects. And yes, I\'m sure you are thinking it, during development I actually realized that this could be helpful for other developers as well, and that\'s how RESTED_DEV was born, YOUR API WITH EASE!\\n\\nNow, I do acknowledge that there are other solutions out there and more powerful than RESTED_DEV. For example Firebase. The difference is, with RESTED_DEV you use plain old HTTP requests, which I\'m sure all of you are familiar with, and you are not required to learn a new library.\\n\\n**Who is this for?**\\n\\nFor all developers who need a place to store data, without having to create a back-end service or manage a database. RESTED_DEV does it for you!\\n\\n---\\n\\nDo you have any questions?
